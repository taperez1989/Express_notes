# Express_notes

##Lessons learned:
for the most part the challeneg was straight forward. I did struggle a bit with getting the new notes to actually render to the front end. I had to experiment a bit with my could and after a fair amount of time I had gotten it to at least save to the database. with a little help from the TA's I was able to get it figured out. I had a big moment of excitement when I was struggling early on, when I managed to get the note to render.


##Description

challenge was to set up a connection between the front end and the database. which would allow the user to create and save a new note and render it on the front end.
